Yes, you read that right! While the term "marketplace" might bring to mind commercial platforms, we're committed to keeping the "open" in OpenXCH Here's what that means:
* **Free and Accessible**: All of our community discussions, and most of the projects hosted within OpenXCH are open-source, adhering to established open-source licenses. This ensures that the source code remains freely available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute.
